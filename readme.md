Experimental superhero game for http://www.superherohill.com

The goal will be to create a game on how to be a superhero.

The minetest engine will mostly likely be used to create the prototype.

The goal of Superhero Hill and the game is to help people become real life superheroes.  My definition of a superhero is that a hero helps people and a superhero helps a lot of people.

To become a superhero I will help you find your real life superpowers, train your body and mind, and go out into the world to help people and the environment.
